# filterCombos
At the GlueX experiment, each event per run number has the possibility of having multiple combos. These scripts will rank each combo by their chi^2 such that the combo with the best chi^2 can be chosen to reduce background in a channel. These scripts were developed to determine the best combo per event and run number using GlueX photo-produced data. This method is to replace the unnecesary weighting procedure done at the experiment known as "accidental subtraction".
